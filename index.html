I'm a C++/Java Developer with interest in full stack development. I blog very short, easy to understand tutorials for people who don't have time or patience. I try to create animations and pictures with less text. Here are the list of all posts in my github pages
     
      
<p>
  <ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
